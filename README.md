# Flappy bird clone

This is a clone of the famous game flappy bird. The main purpose of this project is to gain some practice with golang, it isn't a super interesting project, but as it is a game it's fun :)

This is how it looks up to now:

## Building

A `go build .` will do to build the program. The only dependency for the project is an installation of SDL2 on the building system and the SDL2 binding for go, instructions can be found here: [https://github.com/veandco/go-sdl2](https://github.com/veandco/go-sdl2)
